Communication Procedures

We will communicate through group text and Zoom (if needed) asynchronously and meet in person before or after classes synchronously. The expectation is that all communication will be responded to promptly. We will handle instructor correspondence by informing each other with text messages to the group text.











Meeting Schedule

We will meet before class from 10am-12pm on Monday-Wednesday. We will also meet from 6-8pm on Monday and Tuesday if more work is needed.

Methods of Group Communication
1. Group Text
2. Phone Call
3. Email



Meeting Coordination

We will have a group text to remind each other of assignments and meetings.
We will change or add meeting times based on work needed to be done.
The preferred method for meetings are face-to-face meetings or virtually (Zoom) when necessary.
Meeting Location: PRLTA 103
 
Roles and Responsibilities

Role
Duties
Meeting Leader (Gabriel)
Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting
Meeting Recorder (Matt)
Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned
Assignment Leader (Shawn)
Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date
Project Monitor (Roy)
Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status


We will have rotating roles which will change once a month based on knowledge and significance on each assignment and project. We will meet weekly to help one another meet each other's responsibilities. We will check in with everyone in our meetings either in person or over Zoom if they have certain issues about the project. We will follow the team activities and track milestones through the group text. Technical responsibilities will be assigned team members based on their skill set of the given task.

Team Coordination and Accountability

We will make sure that assignments are completed before the deadlines by checking in with each team member through the group chat that the assignment is ready for submission. We will ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required to complete each assignment by teaching and helping each other. We ensure that feedback from the design review is issued and acted upon by every team member through in person meetings, group text and virtually meetings through Zoom.

We will address missed assignments, contributions or actions by discussing them during meetings and analyzing next steps like different role responsibilities. We will hold each other accountable described in the charter by splitting up work accordingly and report any news to the group chat. Team members will look out for one another if any team member is underperforming. Team members will help underperforming team members improve by working through the assignment or project they are struggling on. The consequence of a team member underperforming is a pink slip. 

Conflict Recognition & Resolution

We will meet and communicate in our group chat regularly about our progress and address disagreements that emerge.  If someone has a concern, we will find ways to help alleviate the problems that we are having and decide as a team how to carry on. A problem would be escalated to the instructor if we still can not resolve the issue.
