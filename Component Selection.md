# Component Selection
Major component selection was completed by researching different options, optaining necessary details from reviews and datasheets.  The top three options were evaluated and based on the user needs and the project parameters, the best one was selected for order.

## **Humidity Sensors**

Option 1                
1649-SHT40-AD1B-R2CT-ND
Sensor Humidity 100RH SMD, $2.58/each

Pros:  I2C, Low power, SM, Low price, 0~100% Humidity range

Cons:  6 sec response time, +-1.8% RH Accuracy

Option 2

1649-SHT45-AD1B-R3TR-ND
Sensor Humidity 100RH SMD, $7.18/each

Pros: I2C, Low power, SM, 0~100% Humidity range

Cons: 6 sec response time, +-1.5% RH Accuracy, $5.38 more for a 0.3% accuracy difference


Option 3

497-15382-2-ND
Sensor Humidity 100RH SMD, $5.36/each
  
Pros: I2C, SPI, Very Low power, SM, 0~100% Humidity range, 6 sec response time, +-4.5% RH Accuracy

Cons:  Poor price to performance


Option 4

296-HDC3021DEHRTR-ND
Sensor Humidity 100RH SMD, $5.61/each

Pros:  I2C, Very Low power, SM, 0~100% Humidity range, +-0.5% RH Accuracy

Cons:  4 sec response time, More than double the price of option 1

### **Chosen part is Option 4**

296-HDC3021DEHRTR-ND provides the best price to performance, with a higher accuracy than all of the other selected options. Although it is more expensive than option 1, when compared to similarly priced models it has much greater performance with a very low response time. It also meets the surface mount and I2C requirements.

## **Temperature Sensors**

Option 1

TC74A4-3.3VCTCT-ND Temperature Sensor, $1.15/each

Pros:  It is already in Peralta Lab,  Inexpensive, The range of temperature is good

Cons:  It is very small which is hard for soldering, The datasheet does not have a circuit with it


Option 2

568-4768-1-ND Temperature Sensor, $0.91/each

Pros:  Cheapest option,  Extensive datasheet, Has the biggest width to help with soldering

Cons: Has 8 pins compared to the others, Has the highest voltage supply


Option 3

DS1775R+T&RCT-ND Temperature Sensor, $3.21/each

Pros:  Has the most features, High Resolution, Is a combination of the other options
Cons:  Does not say how large it is, Most expensive
