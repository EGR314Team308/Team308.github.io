|                         | “Very satisfied with this weather station. The color display is bright and easy to read. The instruction manual was very helpful with setting up the station. Have had it since Christmas and so far the accuracy has been very good.” | 1. The weather station is bright and clear to read. (explicit)                                                          |

| Negative Comments       | “First things first. I ordered one of these and it never shipped then went into limbo. Amazon sent a replacement and when it got here it was obvious it had already been opened and taken out of the packaging. The box also looked as though it sat on a shelf in a sunny window. No mounting hardware for the sensor or display and although the protective screen cover was still on the display I have suspicion this was possibly a returned item. Second or is it third... Wildly inaccurate. Compared to 2 different branded similar products this one is off by 1-3 degrees on temp and at least 6+ on humidity. It's also not very bright. There seems to be 3 brightness settings but mine just goes from low to high (or as high as this unit will go). When I press the button a third time nothing changes. I bought it on a deal and I guess I should have known better. I'm bummed because I really like the display and there's so many good reviews.” | 1. The weather station needs the temperature to be right. (explicit)                                              |

|                         |                                                                                                  | 3. The weather station needs to be working after a period of time. (latent)                                      |

|                         | “This Anemometer is huge compared to my necklace, one that fits in the palm of my hand, but the bulk doesn't take away from its sensitivity. We fly a lot of kites and this helps us choose which ones to put up in the air. Overkill? Maybe, but we love our kites!” | 1. The environment sensor has good sensitivity.

| Negative Comments       | “I wanted to measure the air stream coming out of the diffusers in refrigerated cases to determine if there was blockage in the case or fans weren't working well. The propeller didn't rotate and I had to give it a flick of the finger to get it to start rotating. Annoying. Also didn't like the length of time it took to get an accurate temperature reading. I gave up on that right away. I returned the anemometer and am looking for another that works well with low air speeds. It did work well on HVAC outlets, but here the air speed is higher.” | 1. The environment sensor gives feedback in a timely manner. (explicit)                                       |

**Price:** $139.00

**Vendor:** Amazon

**Description:** A next-gen controller designed to provide AC Infinity devices with smart programming to produce the most optimized environment. This central command unit connects with up to four different devices from fans to lights to provide each with independent climate and time-based programming. The backlit display reads temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius and can be switched off while programs run in the background. Built with a kickstand and includes hardware to be hung on walls. The 12-foot sensor probe with thermal-alloy head accurately detects current temperature and humidity. It also detects VPD (vapor pressure deficit), which measures ambient temperature, relative humidity, and the plant’s leaf temperature in order to determine the optimal atmosphere. This allows you to monitor growing conditions more closely than if you were to rely on temperature and humidity alone. This product is a part of the UIS™ platform of growth devices and smart controllers, designed to integrate with each other to achieve your ideal environment.

|                         | “Ok, we’ll it’s the best one today and is incredibly programmable. It doesn’t matter if you are using their smart plugs for other manufacturers products or their direct connect devices; they work flawlessly! Set up all kinds of schedules with parameters that allow for incremental fan speeds, light schedules, feeding times. There is no end to the possibilities with this controller. Purchase an inexpensive UIS splitter and control multiple devices through just one port. Daisy chain up to 64 devices on one controller. You can program multiple intensive programs for different “seasons” and scenarios. As you can tell, I’m over the top on this company’s product and cannot say enough good things. If you think that because the equipment seems less expensive than others; just know that the quality is there and backed by a 2 year warranty.

|                         | “WAYYY better than the regular 69 that came with my inline fan... and not just because it's Wifi (which is enormous).... The 69 Pro turns my fan ON when my humidity gets above 72%... ramps up from lvl 1 to lvl 3 (as I set it to do)... until my RH is below that threshold. So now I can maintain a constant RH between 69 and 72... before the fan would turn on only at high lvl.. and would bounce my RH all over the place.... Now I can maintain a constant vpd of .86 - .95... which is perfect for veg....” | Improvement on the base model with Wi-Fi, ensures precise fan control based on humidity, maintaining a stable RH (69-72) and ideal VPD (.86-.95) for vegetables.

Instead, the UI is confusing, and then even when you think you've figured it out you hit one of the numerous bugs present in the firmware and it still doesn't work as advertised. It IS possible to get it to work - but it's difficult, frustrating, and will require a lot of reading on how to get around the many bugs in the software.
