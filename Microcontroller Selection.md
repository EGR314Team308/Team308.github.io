6. Final Microcontroller Choice: Option 3 PIC16(L)F15354
Rationale: This microcontroller has all the capabilities we need and extra pins in case they are needed.  It is available in multiple form factors that we should be able to solder without extreme difficulty.  It is low power, but the voltages match our use case.  It may have some limitations with the max current, but we should be able to work with that. It also covers all team project requirements.
