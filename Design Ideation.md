3. Create three product concept sketches  

Greenhouse Regulation System

The goal of the Greenhouse Regulation System would be to effectively cultivate the ideal environment for growing plants within the greenhouse. The current design would feature the ability to track internal and external data and identify what needs to be done to adjust the current environment within the greenhouse. This could include opening and closing greenhouse doors, dispersing water, etc. Solar panels would be placed directly above to help with power consumption, and a screen would be placed on the front to monitor data.

Mars Weather Station

The Mars Weather Station is a robotic vehicle designed for exploring the surface and monitoring atmospheric conditions. The rover is equipped with sensors to study and report on weather patterns, temperature variations, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and wind speed on Mars.

Wind Farm Weather Station

Turbines on wind farms need to be slowed and shut down when there is too much wind, icy conditions, or if there are birds or other animals flying through the area.  

The weather station design below will detect these conditions and control the turbine by adjusting the direction of the turbine using a yaw drive to slow the turbine and braking and slowing by applying pressure to the shaft with a brake pin and stopping by inserting the pin into the axle shaft if lockout is needed.

Layout and components of the proposed design are shown in figures 1,2, and 3.
