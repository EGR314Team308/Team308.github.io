## Team Organization

Team 308 was made to create a weather station that measures different environmental conditions. The team first talked about the team charter and team goals to see how each member wanted the team to both perform in the project and what the project should entail. The team goals listed below were created in a team meeting where every member had input into the teams ultimate goals. 

### Team Goals

Our project will provide consistent, reliable, and accurate sensor input. <br>
The project will have a real-life application that would have a significant impact for users. <br>
Further our passion and knowledge in working with microcontrollers. <br>
Motorized components in the project will work consistently to produce useful results. <br>
The project will be able to fulfill all safety and project requirements. <br>

The product mission statement listed below was talked about during a team meeting that satisfies both the project that the team wants to build and fulfills the project requirements.

### Product Mission Statement

The product will be reliable and work accurately to determine environmental conditions and use that data to determine and execute actions that are impactful for our project.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

The team started the user needs process by finding and writing down 5 different products that relate to a mobile weather station. The purpose of this was to see the good and bad reviews that were on these products in order to either implement or provide aspects that the device did not. This allows the team to see the user needs in the available market. Below in the link are the 5 products or Voice of the Customer Benchmarking that the team chose.

# Organize

The team organized the 100 user needs below based on the latent and explicit to see the main problems with current products. This allowed the teams to combine and split the user needs into 8 different catagories.
